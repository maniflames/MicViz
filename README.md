# Microphone
My twist on [Justin's tutorial](https://www.worthe-it.co.za/programming/2017/08/14/rusty-microphone.html). 

NOTE: 
You have to install portaudio yourself!
for macos use homebrew
to install macos sdk headers for audio stuff
```
open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
```
